# rust-learning-notes

Keran is using this repository to take notes while learning Rust programming language.

### Things that I skipped
I skipped some topics because of my personal interests and learning goals. Would definitely revisit them in the future.
- Implementing an Object-oriented Design Pattern in Rust - State Pattern
- Integrating with a foreign language - FFI.
- Using Miri to Check Unsafe Code.
- Macros in Rust.
