// Note: A binary crate must have a main function as the entry point.
// Cargo follows the convention that the main function is located in src/main.rs.
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}

// Note: A package can contain multiple binary crates by placing additional source files in the src/bin directory.
// Each file in src/bin is treated as a separate binary crate with its own main function.
